<h2>Creativity in Question</h2>

A substantial degree of curiousity pervades among scholars as to what takes place in the creative mind; and what can mankind learn in relation to stimulating, harnessing, and in some sectors of society actually harvesting, the creative genius in people. The importance of such study is of course crucial to economics, and innovative inventions and programs within industries and organisations can and will work wonders towards a successful economy (Lubart & Sternberg 1998 p3) The study of creativity has not been without its barriers and limitations and the authors attest in their article (1998) that creativity remains a very important field which isn't being adequately researched.

Creativity, absolutely vital as it is to optimal human functioning, and being widely evident in everything man-made in our environment, has a relatively short studied history. The importance of studying creativity has only really been talked about in the years since 1950, after J.P. Guilford's plea to the American Psychological Association on behalf of making creativity a focal point of psychological inquiry (Simonton 2000 p151)

There are many definitions of creativity- evidence of the profoundly complex phenomenon it actually is. However, should a requirement exist to provide a common, universal understanding; a fundamental and widely held meaning of the word 'creative' may suffice. This broadly held view maintains that it is having the ability to create or produce something original and valued, especially by using imagination (Davis 2002 p4). It is having the capacity to manifest or produce an artifact, event or circumstance; the process being aided and guided by the human imagination.<br><br>

There is a sequence of neurological steps which take place when creativity takes place in the human mind. This process inside the mind transfers to a tangible worthwhile product in the material world. The creative process is the process of change (Ghiselin 1996 p3), it is when something is evolving into a more valuable or enhanced state with the assistance and facilitation of an inventive mind.

The creative process may be said to be at its greatest potential when we are able to keep our minds open and our questions alive. There are many dramatic instances in history, especially in the sciences, where creative people have opened up new horizons through constant questioning, and holding open their imaginations(Carley 2005 p30). By keeping ourselves open to learning something new, we are taking a risk. We are exposing ourselves to the possibility that our way of living in the world, and our very self-understanding, may take a radical change.  The voice that questions why is 'this' accepted, or why should we accept 'that', is an essential flame, I would suggest, for the evolution of mankind.<br><br>

It can be proposed that creativity is very much about innovation. Creativity exists in the birth of new ideas and initiatives; these usually occur after a person has perceived an object/s, a scenario, a situation, a problem or a difficulty. It is not something that explodes into existence as a flash of light, instead it emerges as a series of sparks. Each new idea or invention is built on top of earlier ideas (Sawyer 2007 p15).<br><br>

While innovation is undoubtedly a big part of creativity; refinement and modification can be just as important. Individuals use their imagination, often fired by such useful inclinations as doubt and curiousity, to find novel ways to structure things. Creativity may be, and often is, a restructuring of what is already there (Donnelly 2004 p156), thus improving it.

It is not difficult to make the case that when an outstanding discovery or invention is made in the sciences, it is something which has been built on top of a lot of dedicated work and inventions that have preceeded it. The same is actually true of the arts, even though there is perhaps a tendency to forget that; to somehow assume that a brilliant piece of art suddenly appears as if on a blank mind (Foss 2006 p116). The artist must first fall in love with his/her field; with the great works of music, the great painting styles, the finest methods and techniques in human history. These become foundations for their own creativity, and for making their own contributions. A pertinent example Foss alludes to here (2006 p117) is of great composers such as Stravinsky who took inspiration and influence from earlier greats like Bach, and found ways to build upon it to create his own offerings.

Furthermore, the myth of the lone genius, the single flash of creative genius behind the most notable inventions in our history must give way to a more sobering reality- that creativity is a group activity, informed as it it by past ideas, expressions and failures (McCulloch-Lovell 2005 p15); it thrives on collaboration. It is also, as Sawyer notes (2007 p7), something that can emerge when we least expect it, when the mind is otherwise occupied. The great creators are the ones whose mind is a prepared and tilled pasture which is best prepared for these moments of inspiration.

It is through experience and purposeful dedication to ones chosen field, that an elevated level of profiency can be achieved. This can give a person the capability of acting in a virtually automatic manner while applying their skills and knowledge to their activities. This 'automaticity' (Sternberg 1995 p346) is actually a corollary of what is often years of hard work and devotion.
nd add to their own self-image. I equate this trait to emotional intelligence and it allows me to experience novel emotions depending on what situation I find myself dealing with- I believe this amounts to a certain degree of emotional creativity.

To conclude, the new concepts I encountered, since sitting the creativity module, have brought a level of understanding as to how the creative process may function within the mind. It explains how I reached my decision for my final project, how pre-existing thoughts and concerns merged with new ideas as they came; to provide me with the components of a plan that would develop into something new and unique. The inspiration for the subject of the final project is not something that came all at once, or as a single idea, but rather a culmination of a group of concerns and interests which have taken place within my consciousness in the last few years. For instance, in an earlier module that I completed for my All Hallows degree, the Power and Justice module, I penned a debating argument which defended the assertion that power corrupts. Through the position I adopted, I made what I felt was a strong case in this defense; and consequently emerged from it with a relatively strong conviction that power, more specifically power of authority over others, is in many respects a poisoned chalice when in the hands of individuals. When considered, and certainly aided through the process of incubation, the idea developed itself into a plan. In combination with many other concerns that have arisen in my mind about the current and accepted systems of governance that are widely in use in todays world; the spark of creativity when it came found itself substantiated by all these prior knowledge threads which I had been exposing myself to. While perhaps not designing or inventing something unheard of; I was content that I had created a roadmap for a final project. I had found a direction that will stimulate my mind and intellect, so that I will have the appetite and the devotion to accomplish a conscientious work. As I come towards the final stage of my four years work in All Hallows, I more fully appreciate my creative capabilities; and I have a well founded framework to support all the future endeavours when I want use my creative faculties- a framework buttressed by doubt, questioning, an open mind and my imagination.
