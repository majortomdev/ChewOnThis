<h2>Creativity in Question</h2>
  When I consider the directions I took and the permutations that were made during the capstone sequence of my All Hallows degree, through the lens of what I have learned about creativity; I can identify several strands of what is covered in the literature. As I have the majority of the sequence already complete, the majority of this piece will be retrospective. For me, the writing of this has functioned as a valuable reflective process that helps me further understand the theory assimilated over the span of the creative module, and in a wholly practical sense. The first part of the article will be some of my perspective of why we want to study creativity and what it, and the term the creative process, actually mean. I will complete the paper by merging what I have learned about creativity with what I have done over this last year and in what I have planned for my final project.<br><br>

A substantial degree of curiousity pervades among scholars as to what takes place in the creative mind; and what can mankind learn in relation to stimulating, harnessing, and in some sectors of society actually harvesting, the creative genius in people. The importance of such study is of course crucial to economics, and innovative inventions and programs within industries and organisations can and will work wonders towards a successful economy (Lubart & Sternberg 1998 p3) The study of creativity has not been without its barriers and limitations and the authors attest in their article (1998) that creativity remains a very important field which isn't being adequately researched.

Creativity, absolutely vital as it is to optimal human functioning, and being widely evident in everything man-made in our environment, has a relatively short studied history. The importance of studying creativity has only really been talked about in the years since 1950, after J.P. Guilford's plea to the American Psychological Association on behalf of making creativity a focal point of psychological inquiry (Simonton 2000 p151)

There are many definitions of creativity- evidence of the profoundly complex phenomenon it actually is. However, should a requirement exist to provide a common, universal understanding; a fundamental and widely held meaning of the word 'creative' may suffice. This broadly held view maintains that it is having the ability to create or produce something original and valued, especially by using imagination (Davis 2002 p4). It is having the capacity to manifest or produce an artifact, event or circumstance; the process being aided and guided by the human imagination.<br><br>

There is a sequence of neurological steps which take place when creativity takes place in the human mind. This process inside the mind transfers to a tangible worthwhile product in the material world. The creative process is the process of change (Ghiselin 1996 p3), it is when something is evolving into a more valuable or enhanced state with the assistance and facilitation of an inventive mind.

The creative process may be said to be at its greatest potential when we are able to keep our minds open and our questions alive. There are many dramatic instances in history, especially in the sciences, where creative people have opened up new horizons through constant questioning, and holding open their imaginations(Carley 2005 p30). By keeping ourselves open to learning something new, we are taking a risk. We are exposing ourselves to the possibility that our way of living in the world, and our very self-understanding, may take a radical change.  The voice that questions why is 'this' accepted, or why should we accept 'that', is an essential flame, I would suggest, for the evolution of mankind.<br><br>

It can be proposed that creativity is very much about innovation. Creativity exists in the birth of new ideas and initiatives; these usually occur after a person has perceived an object/s, a scenario, a situation, a problem or a difficulty. It is not something that explodes into existence as a flash of light, instead it emerges as a series of sparks. Each new idea or invention is built on top of earlier ideas (Sawyer 2007 p15).<br><br>

While innovation is undoubtedly a big part of creativity; refinement and modification can be just as important. Individuals use their imagination, often fired by such useful inclinations as doubt and curiousity, to find novel ways to structure things. Creativity may be, and often is, a restructuring of what is already there (Donnelly 2004 p156), thus improving it.

It is not difficult to make the case that when an outstanding discovery or invention is made in the sciences, it is something which has been built on top of a lot of dedicated work and inventions that have preceeded it. The same is actually true of the arts, even though there is perhaps a tendency to forget that; to somehow assume that a brilliant piece of art suddenly appears as if on a blank mind (Foss 2006 p116). The artist must first fall in love with his/her field; with the great works of music, the great painting styles, the finest methods and techniques in human history. These become foundations for their own creativity, and for making their own contributions. A pertinent example Foss alludes to here (2006 p117) is of great composers such as Stravinsky who took inspiration and influence from earlier greats like Bach, and found ways to build upon it to create his own offerings.

Furthermore, the myth of the lone genius, the single flash of creative genius behind the most notable inventions in our history must give way to a more sobering reality- that creativity is a group activity, informed as it it by past ideas, expressions and failures (McCulloch-Lovell 2005 p15); it thrives on collaboration. It is also, as Sawyer notes (2007 p7), something that can emerge when we least expect it, when the mind is otherwise occupied. The great creators are the ones whose mind is a prepared and tilled pasture which is best prepared for these moments of inspiration.

It is through experience and purposeful dedication to ones chosen field, that an elevated level of profiency can be achieved. This can give a person the capability of acting in a virtually automatic manner while applying their skills and knowledge to their activities. This 'automaticity' (Sternberg 1995 p346) is actually a corollary of what is often years of hard work and devotion.

This experience and dedication provides, as mentioned above, a fertile pasture from which creativity can occur; it needn't, therefore, be something mystical. Sternberg (1995 p361) mentions the 'nothing special' point of view that some theorists have towards insight. This vantage point regards very creative individuals as only being essentially different from 'less creative' people in the extent to which they apply themselves. They are deeply committed to the creative endeavour, to their respective fields. They gain valuable expertise from their many hours spent working hard and studying the work of their predecessors. The creative spark, or insight, is very often the apex of a large body of focused and determined activity. Immersion in this kind of environment can serve as a well from which creativity can spring; from which our divergent thought processes, alongside those of our convergent thoughts can contribute towards the production of valuable kernels of ideas.

It was the aforementioned J.P. Guilford who first coined the distinction between convergent thinking and divergent thinking. He described the former as processes that lead to a single, correct conclusion; and the latter as processes that generate multiple possibilities (Nusbaum & Sylvia 2011 p37). Of the great many factors and contributants to what makes a person creative, these two thought processes are commonly held as being paramount. Of the two, divergent thinking is arguably the more linked with creativity, given its association with the generation of new ideas. It can, of course, be proposed that divergent thinking is central to creativity, because many real world problems involve generating many ideas and then reworking them (Beaty & Silvia 2012 p349).

While divergent thinking has been shown to be essential for creativity to take place, it alone is by no means an indication of creativity. Although needed, it is not enough as a single skill towards achieving valued creativity. It is a skill of extremely limited effect without simultaneous convergent thinking and evaluative processes; with which to convert raw ideas into useful products (Batey et al 2011 p462). Convergent thinking is as vital for the creation process as divergent thinking.

Certain skills, making use of divergent and convergent thought processes, are needed for one to be able to question and challenge the accepted way of seeing or perceiving things. Among the antecedent intellectual skills needed for the creative process to begin is, as Sternberg tells us (2006 p88), the synthetic skill to see problems in new ways and to escape the bounds of conventional thinking. The ability to analyse and select the best option of ones generated ideas is also a key skill for optimum creativity; as is the intelligence to actually persuade and sell the ideas to others. As Sternberg tells us, the confluence of these three skills can be a vital precursor to the actualisation of creativity.

After I  completed my externship in the Partnership For Global Justice in New York, I found myself with more questions than answers about what I would substantiate the experience with. I realised it had to be something related to my visit at the Partnership and the adjacent UN Headquarters; yet also something that was meaningful to me. I knew it would have to be something that came from deep within me, something that I could feel intensity and dedication for. I found myself trying to think outside the box but keeping in mind what I know are my passions. I made the connection between human rights, one of the UN's most valued tenets and the recent upheavels in the Arab world; as people there began rising up and seeking a better standing in their respective societies. It proved a valid direction as the Arab world has always found a place in my thoughts and consciousness, as over the years I learnt how unjust many rulers in that part of the world are. I began to get different ideas about what to focus on - what area of the middle east, or what oppressed people, or what event. The Egyptian struggle for democracy was certainly a forerunner in my thoughts. I was beginning to research the history of the Egyptian situation when the recent conflict began in Gaza. I had also been considering the human rights situation there, as well as in the West Bank. I felt it was an opportune time to write a project on something that I did actually feel much stronger about than the Egyptian struggle. I opted then to base my article on human rights and how they exist, or not, for the impoverished people in the city of Gaza. The technological age we are lucky to live in allowed me to add a creative, and compelling, appendix; which chronicled daily life in the city of Gaza for the fifty days that it was under attack. I used the twitter feeds, blogs and press reports of non-governmental operatives, Palestinian reporters, and humanitarian workers on the ground in Gaza. Although in my case I did not need to sell my ideas to anybody, I believe in my compiled project I have made a coercive case to anybody who would question the plight of the Gazans or attempt to justify what they are routinely subjected to. Immersed as I was in the situation in Gaza for the months of August and September, I gave myself ample opportunity to find my own perspective for such events and injustices happening in the world.

Furthermore, albeit on a much more subjective and personal scale, I  needed to uncover a way of adjusting my modes of perception; to forge a closer relationship to a valuable, creative channel of expression- poetry. Poetry is a very personal application that challenges the conventional mode of communicating, of perceiving the world around us. It looks for a unique means by which to interpret and reflect; and communicate to others what the writer sees in their lifetime. Spender has considered poetry as demanding a special kind of concentration (1996 p114). Unlike the kind of concentration needed to solve a problem or work out a sum, poetry requires an awareness of all the possible implications and possibilities to an idea; a little like a plant grows not in one area at a time but in all its parts towards the sun and warmth.  Furthermore, poetry is an inventive process wherein the poet has usually spent a great deal of time internalising the craft of perceiving things in a way that is unique; dissimilar to the common, accepted modes of interpretation (Wirtz 2014 p66). Through years of disciplined practice, the creative poet is now free to draw from richer cognitive resources; thereby enabling the creativity within to continue to find its way into the outer world.

I have not often found poetry accessible and there have been countless times where I really struggled to comprehend a poem. This has resulted in an antipathetic relationship having formed between myself and poetry. Poetry, however, was an important component of the Literature and Spirituality double module which I sat at the start of 2014. I wrestled with my inner self about how I would deal with the situation, as poetry was actually such a large part of the module; meaningful as it is held in the world of literature.

I read through several poetry books, trying to find a poet that I, in some useful way, identified with. Even though I identified to some extent with a few, the only poet I felt in some way confident about analysing was the great Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh. I realised I would need to read and reread his poetry, something I hadn't ever really done with any verse. In doing this, I immersed myself fully in the writings and thoughts of Kavanagh, something I now know gave me the greatest opportunity to create something, to make my own unique interpretation. I dedicated long study hours to try and see things as he saw them. It allowed me to write the subsequent review and article about his contributions. I had actually allowed myself to be somewhat enveloped by the domain of the word, something which many theorists such as Csikszentmihalyi (1996 p239) believe provides the greatest possibility for creativity to occur for a writer.

This exposure, to the thoughts and musings of an eminently creative person, granted me an appreciation of the value of a more focused way of perceiving things. It provided me with a few tools with which to reframe the normal, the conventional, the accepted view of everyday elements in life. It also brought my attention to the flexibility and adjustability of emotions and our emotional responses to external sensations; something that has more recently led me to wonder about the connection with creativity.

The relation between creativity and emotions has long been perceived in popular parlance (Averill 1999 p230). The common cliche of the mad scientist or the temperamental artist are examples of how people tend to link creativity and emotions. Yet the link between the two is far from lucid. Emotions have tended to be viewed as facilitating, inhibiting or just as some kind of by-product of creative endeavours, as Averill goes on to draw attention to. A less common conception is the consideration of the emotion itself as a creative product.<br><br>

The issue of emotional intelligence, emotional creativity, and the relationship between the two thus resonated with me when we touched on it in creativity; it being a topic which emerged during the module. The difference between the two is annotated clearly by Brackett et al in their aptly titled article Emotional Intelligence and Emotional Creativity(2007 p200). Emotional intelligence is about a persons ability to understand, reason with and regulate their emotions as they experience them; emotional creativity, on the other hand, is more closely related to the richness of a persons emotional life. An emotionally creative person has a more enhanced ability to experience and express a greater range of emotional combinations.

When working in the woodwork cabin in the youth development charity as part of my internship, I was creative in how I spoke to the children. I believe this is an innate ability within my psyche which explores ways to let other people display and take pride in their own efforts, or at least a way that shows interest in them and that their thoughts count. In this case, it was asking the boys and girls suitable questions about work completed in the cabin, or work that was in progress; that allowed them to answer pridefully, in a way that helps to build and add to their own self-image. I equate this trait to emotional intelligence and it allows me to experience novel emotions depending on what situation I find myself dealing with- I believe this amounts to a certain degree of emotional creativity.

To conclude, the new concepts I encountered, since sitting the creativity module, have brought a level of understanding as to how the creative process may function within the mind. It explains how I reached my decision for my final project, how pre-existing thoughts and concerns merged with new ideas as they came; to provide me with the components of a plan that would develop into something new and unique. The inspiration for the subject of the final project is not something that came all at once, or as a single idea, but rather a culmination of a group of concerns and interests which have taken place within my consciousness in the last few years. For instance, in an earlier module that I completed for my All Hallows degree, the Power and Justice module, I penned a debating argument which defended the assertion that power corrupts. Through the position I adopted, I made what I felt was a strong case in this defense; and consequently emerged from it with a relatively strong conviction that power, more specifically power of authority over others, is in many respects a poisoned chalice when in the hands of individuals. When considered, and certainly aided through the process of incubation, the idea developed itself into a plan. In combination with many other concerns that have arisen in my mind about the current and accepted systems of governance that are widely in use in todays world; the spark of creativity when it came found itself substantiated by all these prior knowledge threads which I had been exposing myself to. While perhaps not designing or inventing something unheard of; I was content that I had created a roadmap for a final project. I had found a direction that will stimulate my mind and intellect, so that I will have the appetite and the devotion to accomplish a conscientious work. As I come towards the final stage of my four years work in All Hallows, I more fully appreciate my creative capabilities; and I have a well founded framework to support all the future endeavours when I want use my creative faculties- a framework buttressed by doubt, questioning, an open mind and my imagination.
